<h3>What information is collected and how is it used?</h3>
Automatically collected technical information: Tupix is hosted on Heroku, and Heroku's servers log information about each computer connecting with our site such as IP address, device characteristics, operating system, browser type, type of connection, page and image viewing statistics, and incoming and outgoing links. We may associate this information with images you upload. We also log the metadata associated with any images or videos you upload. None of this automatically collected technical information is associated with any identified person at the time it is collected, but it could be associated with you under two circumstances: First, if you choose to give us personal data about you as described below, the technical information we collect that would otherwise be anonymous could instead be logged as coming from you; and second, if we are required to disclose our server logs as a result of a subpoena or other legal process, some third party such as your internet provider could match our anonymous technical information with you, using information beyond what is found on our servers. 

Personal data you choose to give us: We collect whatever personal data about you that you choose to give us, such as in submission names, image labels or image metadata. We consider such personal data to be "Private Data," and subject to the "Personal Data Protection" paragraph below.

<h3>Personal Data Protection</h3>

Tupix does not disclose to any third party Private Data you have given us. The only exception is if we are forced to disclose the information as a result of a subpoena or other legal process. You may correct, amend, or delete inaccurate Private Data information you have given us. For legal reasons we may retain backup and/or archival copies of information prior to your corrections, amendments, or deletions. We take every reasonable precaution to protect your Private Data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. You are responsible for taking every reasonable precaution on your end to protect any unauthorized person from accessing your Tupix account. 

If you have any questions about our use of your Private Data, please contact us at privacy@tupix.com. Note that we may revise our privacy policy from time to time by posting the changes here.
